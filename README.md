This a pizza making application!  

This was a fun project that I used in order to more familiarize myself with React.js.  I actually had done this for a coding challenge but figured it would be a good opportunity to learn some new stuff at the same time.  Facebook has just announced their "no config" react bundle that includes webpack babel all packaged together to make it very quick to get started with using react.  Suffice to say, I was very excited and eager to have an excuse to try it out, so here it is!

#Usage
In order to make pizzas with this application, it is pretty straightforward.  You simply hit "New Pizza" and a form on the right asks you to type the pizza name in.  To add toppings, simply click them in the  middle of the screen!  Once you're ready to cook the pizza, click "Send it to the fire!" and your pizza with be done... very soon.

#Previous Pizzas
You can also check out previous pizzas that were created.  The last six.  Just click them and see what toppings were on them!
