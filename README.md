This a pizza making application!  

This was done for a coding challenge.  I decided to also take the coding challenge and properly learn React.js at the same time.  I've used react native in the past for an iPhone application, but this was a great opportunity to learn React and do a challenge at the same time.  It was a great learning project that makes everyones favorite food item!  PIZZA!

#Usage
In order to make pizzas with this application, it is pretty straightforward.  You simply hit "New Pizza" and a form on the right asks you to type the pizza name in.  To add toppings, simply click them in the  middle of the screen!  Once you're ready to cook the pizza, click "Send it to the fire!" and your pizza with be done... very soon.

#Previous Pizzas
You can also check out previous pizzas that were created.  The last six.  Just click them and see what toppings were on them!
